Strace proposal (Google Summer Of Code 2017)

Note: If you are not against, I will follow the guideline you given

-> Name:
	Edgar Kaziakhmedov
-> Title of proposal:
	The advanced syscall information tool.
-> Abstract of proposal:
	//TODO
-> Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why is
   it innovative and what it will contribute:
	//TODO
-> Description of previous work, existing solutions (links to prototypes,
   bibliography are more than welcome)
	First of all, I want to improve the informativeness of the ioctl
	syscall(for the range of requests owned to v4l2). For instance,
	the existing information about pixel_format does not show the special
	flags defined in the Linux kernel like V4L2_PIX_FMT_*. Moreover,
	a current switch in the v4l2 ioctl decoder does not process the
	full list of requests. But it is a work just for the April.
	//TODO
-> Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous work, internships
	B.Sc. Applied Physics and Mathematics (third-year student)
	Student of the Department of Radio Engineering and Cybernetics
	Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University)
	Relevant computer science courses:
	computer architecture, operating systems, virtualization, parallel
	programming, computer networks
	Additional CS courses:
	Participant of Intel Lab (virtual machines, introduction to compilators)
	Participant of Intel Lab (C++ course)
	Emulation of computer architecture (implementation of CHIP16 CPU
	commands in Simics)
-> Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal
   (programming languages, frameworks)?
	Advanced GIT knowledge(the commitment to QEMU helped me to achieve it)
	Advanced C knowledge(I so like C, because it makes me feel the hardware)
	Extensive experience in working with open-source projects
	Bash
	X86-assembly
	gdb
	autotools
	gnu make
-> Any previous open-source projects (or even previous GSoC) you have contributed to?
-> Any open-source code of yours that we can check out?
	1) FUSE-based file system(SFS)
	https://github.com/edosedgar/LSB_FUSE_SFS
	Brief description: the main purpose of this project
	was to implement the file system, which can be ported
	to the another architecture by rewriting just the block layer.
	2) The simple binary translator from the own virtual processor
	to the STM32F407 MCU based Cortex-M4
	https://github.com/edosedgar/stm8s/tree/master/STM8S105C6T6/Assembler/Project_2
	3) Development high-performing I/O sub-system for QEMU/KVM
	Brief Description: the implementation of Parallels format driver
	and snapshots
	Research director: Denis Lunev. Head of department in
	Virtuozzo, Inc and QEMU Maintainer
	NOTE: take into account that regardless of the project in the
	development, it does not affect on my commitment to the GSoC
	program(no more than 5 hours per week). If you are interested
	I can send out the current patch set to assess progress made.
	4) Enhanced design for sakura terminal emulator
	http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dabisu/sakura/sakura/revision/560
-> Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may affect you work?
   Any vacations/holidays planned? Will you be available full time to work on your project?
	No vacations planned
	I will be available full time to work at least 40 hours per week.
	Yes, I plan other commitment, as I was saying, to QEMU
	(no more than 4 hours per week, it's sort of hobby project)

To sum up, this program is purposed without doubt to get considerable experience
what it is like to be a part of the large project. And I am applying because I
have some experience in developing and it is a rare privilege to significantly
enhance one of the usefull program for developers.

Just so you know, I mentioned the QEMU several times, but I applied just for
your project.
